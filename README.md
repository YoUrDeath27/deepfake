this is a project made with my colleague 

we didn't trained these AI's by ourselves but we borrowed them, and we will list the sources of the AI's:

for images and videos with no audio we used : https://github.com/polimi-ispl/icpr2020dfdc?tab=readme-ov-file

for audio we used : [https://github.com/Guri10/Deepfake-Audio-Detection-with-XAI/tree/main](https://github.com/Jerald-Golden/Audio-Deepfake-Detection/tree/main)
